# Multi-Label-Medical-text-Classification

With the continuous increase in available data, there is a pressing need to organize it and modern classification problems often involve the prediction of multiple labels simultaneously associated with a single instance. Known as Multi-Label Classification, it is one such task that is omnipresent in many real-world problems.

In this project,i have experimented with various deep learning models
and evaluated them for the task of Multi-label text classification. 
To form a comprehensive representation of the texts i have investigate a powerful
and intelligent feature extraction technique based on deep representation,
which is GloVe. To improve the classification system, LSTM is the most natural
sequence processing model capable of learning long-term dependencies
and remembering past data. As a result, i have presented a comparative
analysis of several recent architectures model based LSTM.

The use of fusing the prediction of all classifiers or selected classifiers in
this work was suggested in anticipation of better performance, regardless of
the base used and to better generalize our contribution.

## The following diagram illustrates the main steps of the approach.
